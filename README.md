- 👋 Hi, I’m @marklwembe
- 👀 I’m interested in lot's of stuff but I'm too lazy to list them here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of everything.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now.
- 📫 How to reach me here on Github, Twitter, Facebook. You'll find me on any social media I'm in as either @marklwembe, mark.lwembe or @lwembe by order of decreasing likeliness.
